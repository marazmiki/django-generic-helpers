Installation
############

With our lovely pip
===================

A stable version is available on `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/django-generic-helpers/>`_, thus
you can install it within ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` (is somebody uses this one?)


.. code:: bash

    $ pip install django-generic-helpers

A development version can be grabbed directly from the `github repository <https://github.com/marazmiki/django-generic-helpers>`_:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/marazmiki/django-generic-helpers#egg=django-generic-helpers


With pipenv
===========

Let's not discuss the pros and cons of this one, it is just used by lots of p
eople. So, to add the dependency into your ``Pipfile`` and then lock it out,
type in your console:

.. code:: bash

    $ pipenv install django-generic-helpers


Or poetry
=========

Yet another package management tool:

.. code:: bash

    $ poetry add django-generic-helpers
